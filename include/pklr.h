/** PKLR - Proprietary Kernel Link Redirect
 *
 *  This interface is used for proprietary algorithms for kernel API selection
 *
 *  WARNING: Interface specified in this header shall be used only to redirect
 *  actual control back to nexo or to some proprietary API.
 *
 *  Nexoid is expecting CTD to contain all relevant data after function return.
 *  It will perform only sanity checks and will abort transaction if they fail
 *  or terminate an application if severe violation was found. It's
 *  responsibility of PKLR module as a member of Trusted Layer to perform all
 *  necessary checks and guarantee CTD consistency after crossing code boundary
 *  between nexoid and (if any) external module.

 *          // 0. Populate kernel data from CTD if needed
 *          // 1. Call Proprietary Build Candidate List or analogous function
